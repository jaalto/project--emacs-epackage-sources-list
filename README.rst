Description
===========

This directory contains the **Yellow Pages** sources list file that
lists Emacs extensions that are available in *Distributed Emacs Lisp
Package System (DELPS)* or simply *Epackage* format.

The listed packages use Git Version Control System (DVCS) containers
for distribution. These epackage repositories, containers, can reside
anywhere publicly available. Their location is recorded in this
**yellow page** file to make them available for users. The person who
wraps Emacs extensions into containers is called epackage
*maintainer*. The person who is he author of the extension is called
*upstream*. These two can be the same or two separate people.
