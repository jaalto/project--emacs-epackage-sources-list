Description
===========

This directory contains the **Yellow Pages** sources list file that
lists Emacs extensions that are available in *Distributed Emacs Lisp
Package System (DELPS)* or simply *Epackage* format.

The listed packages use Git Version Control System (DVCS) containers
for distribution. These epackage repositories, containers, can reside
anywhere publicly available. Their location is recorded in a **yellow
page** file epackage.lst to make them available for users.

The person who wraps Emacs extensions, or Emacs Lisp add-ons if you
wish, into epackages is called the epackage *maintainer*. The person
who is the maintainer of the extension is called the *upstream*. These
two can be the same or two separate persons.
